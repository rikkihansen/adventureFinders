      Today we got into our teams and came up with the idea to make a site for potential campers to use to find the
   perfect camping site for them based off of their interest, experience, ect.. We talked about how we want the pages to be
   laid out and what each page will consists of.
      Our team name is adventrueFinders!!!! Our team is made up of James, Cass and Rikki.

       Brainstorm!! Today was full of brainstorming about everything from how we want the layout of our html, css, js and how
     we are all going to contribute to the project. We started by setting up our Git repository with all of our so far blank html, css and js files. Learning how to use the 'issue' section that is available in GitHub and forking and cloning the main
     repository and making sure that we are all on the same page. Wish us luck!
