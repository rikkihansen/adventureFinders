# adventureFinders
    We are the adventure Finders! This group consists of James, Cass and Rikki, we are a group of motivated soon to be programmers that want to bring skill and technique to everything we do.
    Together we made a page that helps you find the perfect camp ground for you, whether you are wanting a fun outing with
 the family, a coastal adventure or an exclusive mountain hiking adventure we can find a location for you!
    Located on the Finer page you will go through a series of questions to help us better understand the type of camping
 you're looking for, and generate a recommend camp site for you based off the answers you gave.
    We also are always looking to add new camp site's to our ever growing reportage of camps, if you have a camp that you love
 that you don't think we have heard of please let us know by going to our Review page and input your camp information so others
 can enjoy it also!

      Today we got into our teams and came up with the idea to make a site for potential campers to use to find the
   perfect camping site for them based off of their interest, experience, ect.. We talked about how we want the pages to be
   laid out and what each page will consists of.
      Our team name is adventrueFinders!!!! Our team is made up of James, Cass and Rikki.

       Brainstorm!! Today was full of brainstorming about everything from how we want the layout of our html, css, js and how
     we are all going to contribute to the project. We started by setting up our Git repository with all of our so far blank html, css and js files. Learning how to use the 'issue' section that is available in GitHub and forking and cloning the main
     repository and making sure that we are all on the same page. Wish us luck!

       Today I feel like we got a lot of basics done, we got a skeleton for our html as well as our constructor made with an Array
     of our camp sites that we have so far. We are working on a .splice to grab out the array elements.
