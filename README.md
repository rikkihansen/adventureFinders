### adventureFinders






    We are the Adventure Finders! This group consists of James, Cass and Rikki, we are a group of motivated soon to be
 programmers that want to bring skill and technique to everything we do.  
     Together we made a page that helps you find the perfect camp ground for you, whether you are wanting a fun outing with
 the family, a coastal adventure or an exclusive mountain hiking adventure we can find a location for you!
    Located on the Finder page you will go through a series of questions to help us better understand the type of camping
 you're looking for, and generate a recommended camp site for you based off the answers you gave.
    We also are always looking to add new camp site's to our ever growing list of camps, if you have a camp that you love
 that you don't think we have heard of please let us know by going to our Review page and input your camp information so others
 can enjoy it also!
